Dear students,

I have the great pleasure to invite you to the ESIEE Paris International Day on Thursday afternoon, March 15th, with a focus on Asia and China, in the mainstream of the "1month - 1country" serie.
This focus will cover on that day: China, Singapore and Taiwan.

On the programme:

- Sports activities on the theme of China
- Food booth with the international club - Asian menu
- Meet with ESIEE Alumni abroad in China, Singapore and Taiwan (around a virtual glass!)
- Meet through videoconferencing with our university partners and their students : China, Singapore and Taiwan. 
- Experience feedback from ESIEE students during their study abroad period (all destinations) at the M.D.

In addition to teleconferences, this will be the occasion to meet physically between exchange and French students who are currently here at ESIEE. It will be a good time to share experience and culture. If you are coming from China, Singapore or Taiwan, be proud of your culture and let us discover it further, meet also with new classmates and potential friends from France.

This day will be a great occasion to prepare your stay in these countries or to better benefit from your stay in France. Enjoy it !

I wish you all a very happy new Chinese year !
